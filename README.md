# Financial News Analytics

This repository is dedicated to the project "Financial News Analytics" aimed at leveraging financial news data for market prediction, trend analysis, and decision-making processes. The project uses various machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and data analysis techniques to process, analyze, and visualize financial news data.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following key components:
- Data Collection: Collecting and processing financial news articles from various sources.
- Data Processing: Cleaning, structuring, and transforming data for analysis.
- Modeling: Using machine learning algorithms to predict market trends based on news sentiment.
- Visualization: Presenting results and insights through interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Features

- Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of financial news articles to predict market movements.
- Trend Analysis: Identify trends and patterns in the financial news and correlate them with market data.
- Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning models to predict stock prices or market directions based on news content.
- Data Visualization: Interactive visualizations of financial data and news insights.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12
- pip (Python package installer)
- A machine learning environment such as Jupyter Notebook (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/olanak/FinancialNewsAnalytics.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd FinancialNewsAnalytics
   

3. Install the required dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

4. Ensure that you have the necessary APIs and credentials set up for financial news data sources and stock price data.

### Running the Project
